Codes and data – Correa, et al. (2018) Journal of Neuroscience
Maël Lebreton mael.lebreton@unige.ch
This folder contains all codes and data necessary to reproduce the behavioral analyses and results reported in Correa, et al. (2018) J.Neuro. [Correa CMC, Noorman S, Jiang J, Palminteri S, Cohen MX, Lebreton M*, van Gaal S* (2018). How the level of reward awareness changes the computational and electrophysiological signatures of reinforcement learning. Journal of Neuroscience 8(48):10338 –10348 https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0457-18.2018]
Please note that the codes needs Matlab R2014b or a more resent version, with the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.
Cautionary note for Neuroimagers: please note that some neuroimaging toolbox (e.g. SPM, or fieldtrip) contains recoded version of Matlab default functions (e.g. nanmean, tcdf, etc.) which can create some interferences. We advise to temporarily remove such toolboxes from your Matlab paths before running our codes to avoid bugs and compatibility issues.
Behavioral data is contained in the SUB_DATA.mat file, as SubData(X).data matrices (X: subject number), organized as follow:
col1: block number
col2: trial number
col3: (1=right response rewards most, 3=left response rewards most)
col4: reward visibility (1=unconscious, 0=conscious)
col5: reward (1=punishment, 0=reward)
col6: response (1= left, 2 = right)
col7: RT

Please get in touch with your experiences with using the codes and data, and any bug reports or issues to me at mael.lebreton@unige.ch
